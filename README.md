SMS Wakeup
==========
This app is designed for the heavy sleeper. Or for those who wish to have an emergency way to allow friends and family to get through to them regardless of the phone being on silence.

It works by intercepting incomming text messages and seeing if they contains a special string, the default being "Wakeup". If a match is detected the alarm will go off.
