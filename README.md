SMS Wakeup
==========
This app is designed for the heavy sleeper. It allows your contacts to ring the alarm by sending you a text/SMS.

It's also useful for those who wish to have an emergency way to allow friends and family to get through to them regardless of the phone being on silence.

Since some of your friends might not be able to cope with the power which comes with this app it's very simple to blacklist specific contacts.
